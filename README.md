# Vue.js-Fabric.js-Test

## Description

Project started with `@vue/cli`. Testing with vue-test-utils and Jest.
In order to use [fabric](http://fabricjs.com/) with vue I choose to use the [vue-fabric-wrapper](https://github.com/bensladden/vue-fabric-wrapper)

For now I did not manage to get an event to identitfy the fabric object selected by the user so I can't `remove`, `bring to front` or `bring to back`.

Next step is to add `undo` / `redo` buttons
